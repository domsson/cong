Another Pong clone, written in C++ and using SFML.

Motivation
----------
This is my first C++ project. The goal is to get a good grasp of the language's basics.
I also want to wrap my head around the basic concepts and patterns of game programming.
In order to focus on the language instead of OS specific APIs, I decided to use SFML.

Planned features
----------------
- Create a simple, but solid game loop that makes for a fixed game speed across machines
- Come up with and use custom physics as an additional challenge
- Main menu, maybe with an additional Settings menu
- 1 and 2 player mode (and therefore a simple AI)
- Possibility to pause the game

Problems and Learnings
----------------------
- Referencing files (textures): I have no idea how it works on Mac
- Passing pointers/references around: You really need to pay attention to the scope!
